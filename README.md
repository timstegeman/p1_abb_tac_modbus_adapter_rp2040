# P1 - ABB Terra AC EV Chager modbus adapter

This firmware connects to a P1 smart meter and stores the necesaary values in modbus registers needed for the load balancing functionality of the ABB Terra  AC EV charger.

This is only tested with a Sagemcom XS210 smart meter, but could easily be adapted for other ESMR/DSMR formats.

P1 output will be also be available on the USB port of the Raspberrt Pi Pico.
